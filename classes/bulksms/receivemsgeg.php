	/*
	* 1. Save this script to your Web server.
	*
	* 2. Visit the corresponding URL for the script with your browser, to confirm that it is error-free.
	*
	* 3. Find the resulting logged entry (from error_log() below) in your Web server's error log (not the access log).
	* 
	* 4. Next, set this URL as the MO SMS relay URL via your BulkSMS Profile. Send a repliable Mobile Terminating SMS
	* to your phone, reply to it, and you should see a resulting log entry appear in your error log.
	*
	* When we push a Mobile Originating SMS to your relay URL, your script runs just as if you had visited the script's
	* URL in your Web browser. However, the script's output text that would have been displayed to you in the browser,
	* is simply discarded by our calling process. So if you want to know if we have called your URL successfully, you
	* need to log something (as this example does), or add something to a database, or similar.
