Modules have two parts
 a normal action part which can be controlled where it is displayed
a plugin part which shows where needed as long as the module is active

plugin support should be listed at top
prefix m_plug_ to all plugin callable functions

when using plugins in forms, always supply id,datacolumn,pluginname,data as hidden, start the name with module_specs_

the plugin handler is nou standard in the base class and shouldnt be overwritten
